## Description
This project will help you fetch data  from APIs like Shopify and process the resultant data to extract only relevant
pieces to be sent as per the user's requirement.

### Dependencies
All dependencies have been listed in the requirements.txt

#### Execution

1. Make sure that you have virtualenv installed on your machine. Preferably also install virtualenvwrapper so that
activation/deactivation can be done in a simple and straightforward manner.

            ##### installation instructions: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

2. To install other dependencies, use the command:
            ##### pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Navigate to the start of the source code i.e. your location should be at the "Data backup assg" folder.
   Use the command:            ##### flask run --debug
   to run the server and then, use the following GET requests to trigger and process the outputs.

   i. To fetch data from external source: http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch-data
      This will also trigger the processing of data in order to show all available book titles in the store.

   ii. To retrieve processed data containing all book titles: http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch-processed-data
       This will give you a list of all available book titles.

4. I've also attached a POSTMAN collection to aid the user/developer to use the API Endpoints. Please import and use
   them.
